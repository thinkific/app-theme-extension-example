# APP EXTENSION EXAMPLE

This is an example of a Thinkific app extension.

What should be included:

- A `README`: This is where you can document your App Extension.
- A `manifest.json`: This is where you will be able to provide additional info about your App Extension, such as name, author, repository, documentation and support URLs.
- A `sections` folder: This should contain valid Liquid templates. Upon installing the app, a tenant will be able to add these sections to any page in Site Builder.
